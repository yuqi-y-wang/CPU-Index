## ðŸ§  Summary

This project introduces the **Concordance-based Predictive Uncertainty (CPU) Index**, a novel framework designed to quantify the uncertainty of deep learning predictions. By evaluating the consistency among multiple plausible predictive explanations, the CPU-Index improves **interpretability** and **specificity**â€”particularly in the context of distinguishing malignant vs benign lung nodules in **low-dose CT (LDCT)** scans.
